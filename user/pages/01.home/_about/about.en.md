## About us

![RedTail](redtailbig.png)

Welcome to the Claw Recluse, the largest fansite on the internet for Monolith Productions'
classic PC game Claw. This site -- originally started as a hobby in 2004 -- now contains
a forum, over five hundred custom levels, downloads, game info, and lots more.

Renewed in 2020 to be more accessible and better serve Claw fans.
